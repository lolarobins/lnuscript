# lnuscript (lolasnotunix scripting language)
## overview
this project is just for my own learning sake, i intend to make this an interpreted language for the development of plugins and runnable scripts to be called by other programs, as well as a standalone scripting language. i am aiming to have C-like syntax and features with additional features such as namespaces, inline C and assembly to be compiled and cached before runtime, execution within a jailed environment configured by the parent program, generic types, and a concise system for managing dependencies.
